# SubnauticaShadows
Adds a simple shadow multiplayer system to Subnautica.

# What is a shadow multiplayer system?
The idea is that only player positions should be synced and maybe eventually the vehicle they use.  
  
Subnautica was designed as a single-player game, and there are not enough resources for everyone to finish it in multiplayer. Syncing the players only and having everyone play on their own saves fixes this.

# Where is the server?
It's over at https://github.com/Ccode-lang/ShadowServer  

# Warnings
> This software is under active development and is not stable currently. This code is a very early prototype that barely works in some situations.
