# SubnauticaShadows
Adds a simple shadow multiplayer system to Subnautica.

# What is a shadow multiplayer system?
The idea is that only player positions should be synced and maybe eventually the vehicle they use.  
  
Subnautica was designed as a single-player game, and there are not enough resources for everyone to finish it in multiplayer. Syncing the players only and having everyone play on their own saves fixes this.
